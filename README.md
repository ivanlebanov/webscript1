# A Dashboard for developers.
======
A simple dashboard for everyday use. Its purpose is to show most recent commits to all your repositories, entertain and help with structured information.

## Running the server
The server is being started with the command "npm run dashboard".
*N.B.* If you're using a mac it will require sudo rights("sudo npm run dashboard").

## Functionality
The dashboard has a few interesting functionalities:
+ lists random news article for selected providers
+ lists active issues for all repositories of the authorized user
+ uses http://icndb.com to provide a random joke changing every now and then
+ shows a popup message reminding you to stretch out every half hour

## Future enhancements:
+ documentation
+ advertisements
+ multi-dashboard setup
+ running tests on UI and server
